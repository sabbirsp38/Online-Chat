		  		Omegle (oh·meg·ull) is a great way to meet new friends, even while practicing social distancing. When you use Omegle, we pick someone else at random and let you talk one-on-one. To help you stay safe, chats are anonymous unless you tell someone who you are (not suggested!), and you can stop a chat at any time. Predators have been known to use Omegle, so please be careful.
		  	</p>
		  	<p>
		  		If you prefer, you can add your interests, and Omegle will look for someone who's into some of the same things as you instead of someone completely random.
